            <summary>BMR</summary>
            <p>
              Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the amount of energy expended by the body at rest to maintain basic physiological functions such as breathing, circulation, and cell production. It represents the minimum calories needed to sustain life and is influenced by factors like age, gender, body composition, and genetics.

              MAINTAINANCE CALORIES
            </summary>
            <p>
              Maintenance calories refer to the amount of energy an individual needs to consume in a day to maintain their current body weight. This level of calorie intake is balanced with the energy expended through daily activities and basal metabolic rate (BMR). When a person consumes the same number of calories as their maintenance level, their weight tends to remain stable over time.
